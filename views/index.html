        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The American/British English Translator project was built as a part of the FreeCodeCamp Quality Assurance certification. 
            The goal of this project is to convert American English terms into their British English equivalents (and vice versa) 
            by utilizing a set of predefined translations for common words and phrases.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is powered by Node.js, which handles the backend logic for translating the text. The frontend uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
            to take input from the user and display the translation results. The translation logic is implemented using regular expressions to identify and replace 
            American words with their British counterparts, depending on the selected translation direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure the functionality is robust, the project is tested with Mocha, a testing framework for Node.js. Mocha allows us to write unit tests 
            to verify the correctness of our translation function, ensuring that the tool works as expected and handles edge cases correctly.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            1. When the user enters a sentence or phrase in the textarea and clicks "Translate", the system detects the selected language translation direction (American to British or vice versa).
        </p>
        <p>
            2. The translation is done by matching the input text with predefined mappings stored in an object. This object contains common word replacements between American and British English (e.g., "color" -> "colour").
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Once the translation is applied, the result is displayed below in real-time, showing the translated version of the sentence or a message if no changes were needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. The backend logic is built with Node.js, and the translation process is handled efficiently by the server. Mocha testing is employed to validate that 
            the translation functions behave as expected, ensuring the system performs correctly across various edge cases and inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates how to handle text processing, regular expressions, and object manipulation in JavaScript, while also incorporating testing to ensure quality and reliability.
